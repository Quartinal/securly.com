### securly.com
securly.com hidden paths and subdomains

#### Note that you can use [Pentest Tools](https://pentest-tools.com)'s url fuzzer and subdomain finder to scrape websites of their paths and subdomains and get results similar to the ones shown below.

#### Also note that to save time and effort, every path and subdomain in this document was found via a light scan. But if you want to find more and achieve better results, I encourage you to do a deep scan. Also, these links weren't tested on a chromebook, so I encourage you to test them when you have a chance!

#### Lastly note that that not all subdomains and paths discovered with the light scan are shown here, as some of them are APIs that only privileged people can access, while others respond with error status codes.
